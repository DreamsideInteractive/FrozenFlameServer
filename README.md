## F.A.Q.

### Disconnecting from server after 20-30s
Make sure that your server supports `EasyAntiCheat` and players using it as well.
It should be in the end og server log right after start `LogEOSAnalytics: Start Session (User: ...)`

If for some reason it doesn't work - players can play on your dedicated server only without EasyAntiCheat (a second option on Steam game start).
