# Frozen Flame - Local Coop Game Setting
While we are working on in-game settings UI -  you can change your Local Coop game settings ini file.

To make it work just put the next file:
https://github.com/DreamsideInteractive/FrozenFlameServer/blob/main/Game.ini

To your game profile `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/FrozenFlame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor`

And then change settings as you like.

Use that on your own risk, since some settings might not work in multiplayer yet.
