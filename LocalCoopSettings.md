# Frozen Flame - Local Coop Game Setting
While we work on the in-game settings UI, you can change your Local Coop game settings .ini file.

To ensure it works, please insert the following file:
https://github.com/DreamsideInteractive/FrozenFlameServer/blob/main/Game.ini

Into your game profile folder:  `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/FrozenFlame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor`

Then you'll be able to adjust the settings to your liking.

Use it at your own risk and discretion, since some settings might not yet work in the multiplayer.

We strongly recommend to make backups of your Game Saves before applying any changes.
